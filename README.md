# Auction Online - Planning Phase

### Created by **Travis Toal**, 5/2/19

## Description (current)
* _The purpose of this app is to simulate an online auction, allowing many users to simultaneously view the application and make 'bids' on items. The minimum viable product includes a time-dependent auction process, which updates in real-time to show the highest bid and bidder, and a live-chat functionality. This project will use Redux to keep domain data and application state, which will be fed to / pulled from Firebase._
* _The stretch goals include refactoring the application for mobile use in React Native, and the inclusion of a Payment Gateway API such as Stripe to make the auctions functional._
